# How to Use

Note that this tutorial assumes that you are using Ubuntu 18.04. Older versions may not work.

 1. [Install the latest version of Mininet](http://mininet.org/download/) on your local machine. It is fastest to use the second method (*Native Installation from Source*).
    - Install everything with `install.sh -a`. Note that this command installs Mininet on your home directory - you can pick a directory with `install.sh -s mydir -a`
2. In the same directory as example.py, run the command `sudo python example.py`
